# Effects

We have seen in previous lectures that Crust and its categorical semantics only supports pure functions, with no side effects. Side effects are defined as "those actions/processes which affect the external environment": examples include, modifying the value of a variable, printing something to the screen, crashing the program, sending a packet through the network.

In this lecture we informally introduce the concept of effects, which we model using (particular) functors and ad-hoc structure that they support. In the next lecture we will see how this can be modelled categorically, using *monads*.

## Prelude



## Maybe category

```rust
// Idea: Maybe<X> is a value of type X which can sometimes not be provided.
type Maybe<A> = none()
              | some(A)

fn identity(a: A): Maybe<A> => some(a)

fn<A,B,C> compose(f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>, g: Func<B,Maybe<C>>): Func<A,Maybe<C>> =>
  fn(a: A) =>
    match a.f() with
    | none() => none()
    | some(b) => b.g()
```

### Example

```rust
fn checkPassword(s: String): Maybe<String> =>
  if s == "secret123" then
    some("8300 eur")
  else
    none()

fn stringToInt(s: String): Maybe<Int> => // ...

fn extractSign(n: Int): Maybe<Bool> =>
  if n == 0 then
    none()
  else if n > 0 then
    some(true)
  else
    some(false)

> let f = ecompose(checkPassword, ecompose(stringToInt, extractSign))
> f("secret123")
some(true)
> f("notmypass")
none()
```

Observe this very suggestive way of writing programs:

```rust
fn f(n: String) =>
  do s <- checkPassword(n)
     // This part here gets executed only if `s` is
     // available and the previous computation has succeded.
     // `s` can now be used.
     i <- stringToInt(s)
     b <- extractSign(i)
     some(b)
```

We can define a new function `assert` which fails (crashes) whenever a boolean condition is false.

```rust
fn assert(b: Bool): Maybe<Unit> =>
  if b then
    some(unit())
  else
    none()
```

```rust
fn f(n: String) =>
  do s <- checkPassword(n)
     i <- stringToInt(s)
     u <- assert(i >= 10)
     // When i >= 10, the entire code fails.
     b <- extractSign(i)
     some(b)
```

## Bind from compose

How can we express this in terms of effectful compositions? It is easier to express this using a different primitive, called `bind`, which can be defined using effectful composition.

Idea: we have a value (of type `Maybe<String>`) which we want to assign to a variable `s` (of type `String`), in a context which can return again something of type `Maybe<B>`. We model the "context" as simply a function which takes a `String` and returns `Maybe<B>`: the overall result is exactly something of type `Maybe<B>`.

```rust
// The function we would like to have.
fn<A,B> bind(v: Maybe<A>, f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>): Maybe<B>
```

<!--
```rust
fn join: Func<Maybe<Maybe<A>>,Maybe<A>> = ecompose()

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>, g: Func<B,Maybe<C>>): Func<A,Maybe<C>>
  // Pick B = Maybe<C>
fn<A,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Maybe<Maybe<C>>>, g: Func<Maybe<C>,Maybe<C>>): Func<A,Maybe<C>>
  // Pick g = id
fn<A,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Maybe<Maybe<C>>>): Func<A,Maybe<C>>
  // Pick A = Maybe<Maybe<C>>
fn<C> ecompose(f: Func<Maybe<Maybe<C>>,Maybe<Maybe<C>>>): Func<Maybe<Maybe<C>>,Maybe<C>>
  // Pick f = id
fn<C> ecompose(): Func<Maybe<Maybe<C>>,Maybe<C>>
```
-->

This function is actually derivable as a special case of the `compose` function we derived earlier.

```rust
fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>, g: Func<B,Maybe<C>>): Func<A,Maybe<C>>
// Pick A = Maybe<B>
fn<B,C> ecompose(f: Func<Maybe<B>,Maybe<B>>, g: Func<B,Maybe<C>>): Func<Maybe<B>,Maybe<C>>
// Pick f = id
fn<B,C> lift(g: Func<B,Maybe<C>>): Func<Maybe<B>,Maybe<C>> => ecompose(id, g)
// We call it "lift" because we "raise" B into Maybe<B> in the argument position
```

Bind is interderivable using `lift(f) = ecompose(id, f)`:

```rust
// bind = uncurried form of lift
fn<A,B> bind(v: Maybe<A>, f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>): Maybe<B> => ecompose(id, f)(v)
```

> **Compare the two definitions:**
> ```rust
> fn f(n: String) =>
>   do s <- checkPassword(n)
>      i <- stringToInt(s)
>      u <- assert(i >= -10)
>      b <- extractSign(i)
>      some(b)
> ```
> ---
> You can think of the code above as syntactic sugar for this:
> ```rust
> fn f(n: String) =>
>   bind(checkPassword(n), fn(s: String) =>
>   bind(stringToInt(s),   fn(i: Int) =>
>   bind(assert(i >= -10), fn(u: Unit) =>
>   bind(extractSign(i),   fn(b: Bool) =>
>        some(b)))))

## Compose from bind

Interestingly enough, having `bind` is enough to derive the entire `compose` function

```rust
// Assume we are given a function with this type signature.
fn<A,B> bind(v: Maybe<A>, f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>): Maybe<B>

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Maybe<B>>, g: Func<B,Maybe<C>>): Func<A,Maybe<C>>
  fn(a: A) =>
    bind(f(a), g)
```

# Result category

The `Maybe` functor has the usual problem that it does not provide information about the error that it returns. If we instead work with a type isomorphic to `Either<String,_>` we can get more information out of the procedures we use.

```rust
// Idea: Result<X> is a value of type X which can sometimes not be provided.
type Err = String

// Note! Result is just Either<Err,_>.
type Result<A> = err(String)
               | ok(A)

fn<A> identity(a: A): Result<A> => ok(a)

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Result<B>>, g: Func<B,Result<C>>): Func<A,Result<C>> =>
  fn(a: A) =>
    match a.f() with
    | err() => err()
    | ok(b) => b.g()

// Now assert requires an example string message, unless we want to give an empty message
fn assert(message: String, b: Bool): Result<Unit> =>
  if b then
    err(message)
  else
    ok(unit())
```

Let's embellish the previous example by adding error messages to our procedures:

```rust
fn checkPassword(s: String): Maybe<String> =>
  if s == "secret123" then
    ok("8300 eur")
  else
    err("Sorry, you do not have the correct credentials.")

fn stringToInt(s: String): Maybe<Int> => // ...

fn extractSign(n: Int): Maybe<Bool> =>
  if n == 0 then
    err("The amount of money is neither negative nor positive!")
  else if n > 0 then
    ok(true)
  else
    ok(false)
```

An example code:

```rust
fn f(n: String) =>
  do s <- checkPassword(n)
     i <- stringToInt(s)
     u <- assert("Sorry, your balance is too negative for our systems.", i >= -10)
     b <- extractSign(i)
     some(b)
```

## Writer category

```rust
// Idea: Writeful<X> is a value of type X along with a message that this value carries along.
type Writeful<X> = Pair<X,String>

fn<A> pure(a: A) => Writeful<A> => pair(a, "")

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Writeful<B>>, g: Func<B,Writeful<C>>): Func<A,Writeful<C>> =>
  fn(a: A) =>
    match f(a) with
    | pair(b, fOut) =>
      match g(b) with
      | pair(c, gOut) => pair(c, fOut ++ gOut)
      // Append the two outputs together

fn log(a: String): Writeful<Unit> =>
  fn(e: Env) =>
    pair(unit(), e ++ a)

// Note: `ecompose` always makes the log increase, it is not possible to decrease the string length.
```

```rust
fn checkPassword(a: String): Writeful<Bool> =>
  do _ <- log("Password tentative initiated.\n")
    if a == "secret123" then
      pure(true)
    else do
      _ <- log("WARNING: invalid password inserted, password was {a}.\n")
      pure(false)

> do q <- checkPassword("asdf")
     _ <- log("First attempt gave: {p}")
     p <- checkPassword("secret123")
     pure(42)
> pair("Password tentative initiated.\n
        WARNING: invalid password inserted, password was asdf.\n
        First attempt gave: false\n
        Password tentative initiated.\n"
      , 42)
```

## Reader category, function style

```rust
type Env = String

// Idea: Writeful<X> is a value of type X which can be accessed only if an environment is provided, because this value depends on the environment.
type Readful<X> => Func<Env,X>

fn<A> pure(a: A) => Readful<A> => fn(e: Env) => a

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Readful<B>>, g: Func<B,Readful<C>>): Func<A,Readful<C>> =>
  fn(a: A) =>
    fn(e: Env) =>
      g(f(a)(e))(e)

fn withUpdatedEnvironment(update: Func<Env,Env>, v: Readful<B>): Readful<B> =>
  fn(e: Env) => v(update(e))

fn<A> get(): Readful<Env> =>
  fn(a: Env) => a
```

An example:

```rust
fn generateHash(data: Int): Readful<String> =>
  fn(a: Env) =>
    if a == "sha256" then
      generateSha(data)
    else
      generateMD5(data)
```

```rust
fn f(initial: Int) =>
  do a <- generateHash(initial)
     r <- withUpdatedEnvironment(fn(previous: String) => "md5",
            do a <- generateHash(initial)
               b <- generateHash(initial+20)
               pure(pair(a, b))
     m <- get()
     pure(pair(a, r.snd(), m)))
> f("md5")
pair(<md5 of initial>, <md5 of initial+20>, "md5")
> f("sha256")
pair(<sha of initial>, <md5 of initial+20>, "sha256")
```

### Coreadful

Recall the adjunction between products and exponentials.
Each of our functions can be expressed:

```rust
type Coread<X> => Pair<X,Env>

fn<A> pure(x: Coread<A>) => A => x.snd()

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<Coread<A>,B>, g: Func<Coread<B>,C>): Func<Coread<A>,C> =>
  fn(a: A, e: Env) =>
    g(f(a, e), e)
```

## State category

State combines the output effect of writer (without requiring a monoid structure and instead by performing updates effectfully) with the input effect of a reader.

```rust
// Example state: number of times that a password has been entered.
type Env = Int

//                    + previous state
//                    |
//                    v
type Stateful<X> => Func<Env,Pair<Env,X>>
                   // Env --> (Env, X)
                   //         ^    ^
                   //         |    |
                   //         + next state
                   //              |
                   //              + return value

// Idea: Stateful<X> is the type of computations which require a state and return a new state along with a result of type X. The specific value X both depends on the state and changes it, and can be extracted only if a previous state is given.

fn<A> pure(x: A): Stateful<X> =>
  fn(e: Env) => pair(e, x)

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,Stateful<B>>, g: Func<B,Stateful<C>>): Func<A,Stateful<C>> =>
  fn(a: A) =>
    fn(e: Env) =>
      match f(a)(e) with
      | pair(ne, b) => g(b)(ne)

fn get(): Stateful<Env> =>
  fn(e: Env) =>
    pair(e, e)

fn set(new: Env): Stateful<Unit> =>
  fn(e: Env) =>
    pair(new, unit())

fn update(f: Func<Env,Env>): Stateful<Unit> =>
  fn(e: Env) =>
    pair(f(e), unit())
```

```rust
// Stateful using State=Int: the state is the number of wrong attempts tried so far.

// If the password has been tried more than 3 times fail automatically.
// When the password is entered correctly, reset the number of wrong attempts
fn checkPassword(a: String): Stateful<Bool> =>
  do // Check the amount
     n <- get()
     if n > 3 then
       pure(false)
     else
       if a == "secret123" then
         _ <- set(0)
         pure(true)
       else
         // Increase the amount.
         _ <- update(succ)
         pure(false)

> checkPassword("asdf")(0)
pair(1, false)
> checkPassword("asdf")(5)
pair(5, false)
> checkPassword("secret123")(2)
pair(0, false)
```

## List category

The fundamental idea: functions can return more than one result.

```rust
fn<A> pure(x: A): List<X> =>
  fn(e: Env) => pair(e, x)

fn concat(a: List<List<A>>): List<A> =>
  match a with
  | nil() => nil()
  | cons(a, as) => a ++ concat(as)

> concat([[1,2,3],[4,5]])
[1,2,3,4,5]

fn<A,B,C> ecompose(f: Func<A,List<B>>, g: Func<B,List<C>>): Func<A,List<C>> =>
  fn(a: A) =>
    concat(List_map(f(a), g))
//  a.f().List_map(g).concat()
//  f ; List_map(g) ; concat
```

```rust
> do a <- [1,2,3]
     b <- [10,20]
     pure(a + b)
> [11,12,13,21,22,23]

fn rollDice(maxNum: Nat): List<Int> =>
  match maxNum with
  | zero() => []
  | succ(n) => cons(maxNum, maxNum(n))

> rollDice(6)
[6,5,4,3,2,1]
> rollDice(3)
[3,2,1]

> do a <- rollDice(6)
     b <- rollDice(3)
     pure(pair(a, b))
> [(6,3),(6,2),(6,1),
   (5,3),(5,2),(5,1),
   (4,3),(4,2),(4,1),
   (3,3),(3,2),(3,1),
   (2,3),(2,2),(2,1),
   (1,3),(1,2),(1,1)]
```
