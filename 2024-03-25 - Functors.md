# Fantastic Functors and where to find them

## Recap: Functors

Given two categories $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal D$, a functor $F : \mathcal C \to \mathcal D$ is given by the following components:

 - A function $F_0 : \mathcal C_0 \to \mathcal D_0$ mapping objects in $\mathcal C$ to objects in $\mathcal D$;
 - For any two objects $X, Y : \mathcal C_0$, a function $F_{XY} : \mathcal C(X, Y) \to \mathcal D(F_0 X, F_0 Y)$, mapping arrows from $X$ to $Y$ into arrows from $F_0 X$ to $F_0 Y$.

These have to respect identities and compositions:

 - For all $X : \mathcal C_0$, $F_{XX} \mathrm{id}_X = \mathrm{id}_{F_0 X}$;
 - For any two consecutive arrows $X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xrightarrow{g} Z$ in $\mathcal C$, $F_{XY} f ; F_{YZ} g = F_{XZ} (f ; g)$.

### Notation

In order to make the formulas readable (and save me some typing), we will denote $F_0 X$ as just $F X$, and $F_{XY} f$ as just $F f$, or occasionally as $\mathrm{map} f$, if the functor involved is made clear by the types.

## Functors in programming

In our main category of interest, $\mathrm{Prog}$, to have a functor we need to have a mapping between types, and for any function between two types, a function on the other side, compatible with identities and composition.

We will see that all types in Crust that are defined from other types using the `type` construct with parameters, actually come with implicit functorial structure! This means that if you can reconduce a type construction in your favourite programming language to a `type` construct in Crust, you should be on the lookout for functorial structures as well.

## `Maybe<_>`

`Maybe` can be seen as a functor, mapping a type `A` to `Maybe<A>`. Then, given `fn f(a: A): B`, we can construct a function `fn Maybe_map_f(ma: Maybe<A>): Maybe<B>` as follows: 

```rust
fn Maybe_map_f(ma: Maybe<A>): Maybe<B> => 
  match ma with
  | none() => none()
  | some(a) => some(f a)
```

## `Pair<K, _>`

For any fixed type `K`, we have a functor `Pair<K, _>` mapping any type `A` to `Pair<K, A>`. Then, given `fn f(a: A): B`, we can construct `fn PairK_map_f(pka: Pair<K, A>): Pair<K, B>` as follows:

```rust
fn PairK_map_f(pka: Pair<K, A>): Pair<K, B> =>
  match pka with
  | pair(k, a) => pair(k, f a)
```

**Question:** what about `Pair<_, K>`?

## `Either<K, _>`

For any fixed type `K`, we have a functor `Either<K, _>` mapping any type `A` to `Either<K, A>`. Then, given `fn f(a: A): B`, we can construct `fn EitherK_map_f(eka: Either<K, A>): Either<K, B>` as follows:

```rust
fn EitherK_map_f(eka: Either<K, A>): Either<K, B> =>
  match eka with
  | left(k) => left(k)
  | right(a) => right(f a)
```
